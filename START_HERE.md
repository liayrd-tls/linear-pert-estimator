# 🚀 Linear PERT Estimator - Start Here!

Welcome! You now have a fully functional PERT estimation tool for Linear.

## ⚡ Quick Start (2 minutes)

### 1. Install & Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Get Linear API Key
1. Visit: https://linear.app/settings/api
2. Click "Create new" under Personal API keys
3. Copy the key (starts with `lin_api_`)

### 3. Configure Environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and paste:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_your_key_here
```

### 4. Open App
Visit: http://localhost:3000

That's it! 🎉

- **README.md** - Full feature documentation
- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** - Technical architecture and roadmap
- **VISUALIZATION_STRATEGY.md** - Design decisions and Linear integration options

## 🎯 What You Can Do Right Now

### Try the Dashboard
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
2. Enter sample estimates (e.g., O=2, M=4, P=8)
3. See live PERT calculations and charts!

### Understand PERT
- **Expected Time**: Weighted average favoring "most likely"
- **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical probability ranges
- **Standard Deviation**: Measure of uncertainty

### Example Task
**"Implement user authentication"**
- Optimistic: 4 hours (everything works first try)
- Most Likely: 6 hours (some debugging)
- Pessimistic: 10 hours (integration issues)

**Result:**
- Expected: 6.3 hours
- 95% confidence: 4.3 - 8.3 hours

---

## 🎨 Visualization Features

### ✅ Implemented (Ready to Use)
- Distribution charts (bar charts showing O/M/P)
- Confidence intervals (68%, 95%, 99.7%)
- Real-time calculation
- Minimalistic design (monochrome + blue)
- Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)

### 🔜 Coming Next
- Linear API integration (fetch teams/issues)
- Multi-task project views
- Timeline/Gantt charts
- Export to PDF/CSV

## 🔗 Linear Integration Approach

**Current:** Standalone web app (most flexible)

**Workflow:**
1. Open Linear in one tab
2. Open PERT estimator in another tab
3. Sync data via Linear API
4. View visualizations alongside Linear

**Why This Way?**
- Full control over visualizations
- Rich, interactive charts
- Easy to maintain
- Works immediately

See `VISUALIZATION_STRATEGY.md` for alternative approaches (browser extension, custom fields, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Charts:** Recharts

## 📊 File Structure

```
Key files to explore:

lib/pert/calculator.ts          ← PERT math
components/ui/TaskEstimateInput.tsx  ← Input form
components/ui/PertDistributionChart.tsx  ← Main chart
app/dashboard/page.tsx          ← Dashboard UI
lib/linear/client.ts            ← Linear API
```

## 💡 Tips for Best Estimates

1. **Optimistic (O):** Best case if everything goes perfectly
2. **Most Likely (M):** Realistic expectation (most important!)
3. **Pessimistic (P):** Worst case with blockers/issues

The formula `(O + 4M + P) / 6` weights M heavily, so focus on getting that right.

## 🤝 Next Steps

1. **Try it out** - Run the app and play with estimates
2. **Connect Linear** - Add your API key to fetch real tasks
3. **Customize** - Modify colors, charts to match your style
4. **Share** - Deploy to Vercel and share with your team
5. **Extend** - Add features from the roadmap (see README.md)

## 🎉 What's Next?

The foundation is built. Here's what you can add:

**Easy wins:**
- Add more chart types (line charts, area charts)
- Customize color palette
- Add dark mode toggle
- Export charts as images

**Medium difficulty:**
- Database to save estimates (PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- OAuth for Linear (instead of API key)
- Multi-task project views
- Team collaboration features

**Advanced:**
- Browser extension
- Mobile app
- Machine learning for estimate suggestions
- Monte Carlo simulations
